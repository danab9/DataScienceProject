genetic risk factors and biomarkers of AD: 
general Ad biomarkers: doi: 10.2174/1567205014666170203125942 
APOE info: doi: 10.1016/S1474-4422(20)30412-9 
 
till now, no accurate diagnosis, only post-mortem, diffcult to differentiate to other neurodegenrative diseases
two types of AD: 
	- early-onset AD (EOAD): rare, autsomal in 5%-10% cases risk genes are APP, PSEN1,2 , rest cases unknown!
	- late-onset AD (LOAD): > 65 years, common type
		- strongest genetic risk factor: APOE gene ( e4 isoform with high prob. for AD, e2/3 lower risk) 
		- other risk genes in lipid, more specific in cholesterol metabolism, immune response and endocytosis
		
AD is characterized by accumulation of two proteins aggregates: 
	- amyloid-ß peptide (Aß) plaques with genes APP and BACE-1
	- neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorhylated tau 

other AD  markers: 

1. mitochondrion:  
	low ATP level -> cell's death 
	dysfunction in mitochondrions processes like fission and fusions
	Mito. Fission-1, DLP-1 : mediaiting fission
		Mito. Fusion-1,-2 , Optic Atrophy-1 : fusion 
		mutations in Presenilin1,2 (PSEN) -> disruption for amyloid precursor protein -> Aß accumalation, which interacts with DLP-1

2. protein p53: 
	Aß peptides interact with HIPK2 degradation -> p53 confirmation is affected by it 
	p53 induces phosphorlyation of 2N4R tau 
	accumalation of p53 and BRCA1

3. protein YKL-40, also a brain cell injury biomarker, increasingly detetected in AD patients ( 50-70 years, so maybe in our young group) 

4. increased D-serine levels in AD


Epigenetic characteristics ( histone modifications):  
doi:10.3390/biom11020195
loss of heterochromatin in AD -> tau-mediated neurodegeneration 
H3K27ac increased: targeting on CR1,GPR22, APP, PSEN1,2, MAPT,...: all involved in tau and amyloid neuropathologies 
H3/4 ac increased: targeting BACE1, PSEN1 as targets
....
