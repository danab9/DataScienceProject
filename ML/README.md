# Machine Learning 

The following scripts are included:
1. `preML_rnaseq.R` - for preperation of RNA-seq data (includes finding ENSEMBL IDS for old hgcn symbols).
2. `preML.R` - for preperation of ChIP-seq data and RNA-seq together.
3. `ML.R` - Application of iClusterBayes (including choice of K) and DIABLO algorithms.

The scripts should be ran by the same order. \
Results are save to the `results` and `plots` folders.
