ChIP-seq Differential Binding Analysis (DBA)

R-scripts: 
- bindanalysis_matrixfiltering.R: create filtered matrix for the DBA
- diffBind_with_error.R : attempt to use the R-package diffBind to exeute a DBA 
- chip_seq_analysis.RMd: following the DBA done by Nativio et al. based on the signal values for the peaks 
- bindanalysis_H3K9ac.sh: ? 

folders: 
- DiffBind_matrices contains matrices for the analyss of chip_seq_analysis.RMd
- plots: plots produced by the notebook 
- results: disease specific enrichedpeaks and disease specific gains for every histone modification as well as their intersection with the RNA-seq DEGs
