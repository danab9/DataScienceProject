ChIP-seq Differential Binding Analysis (DBA)

R-scripts: 
- bindanalysis_matrixfiltering.R: create filtered matrix for the DBA
- diffBind_with_error.R : attempt to use the R-package diffBind to exeute a DBA 
- chip_seq_analysis.RMd: following the DBA done by Nativio et al. based on the signal values for the peaks 
- bindanalysis_H3K9ac.sh: ? 

folders: 
- DiffBind_matrices contains matrices for the analyss of chip_seq_analysis.RMd
- diffBind_results: plots produced by the notebook 
- disease_spec_enriched_peaks and disease_specific_gains: storing all significant peaks of theanalysis
